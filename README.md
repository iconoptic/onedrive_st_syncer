## Docker Container to Synchronize Syncthing and OneDrive

The script synchronizes a folder used by both Syncthing and OneDrive -- using the open source OneDrive application for Fedora. It also transfers a shared calendar from a colleague's OneDrive folder to a staff Sharepoint site, keeping the shared calendar updated in real time.

## To-Do:

1. Add documentation for setting up config and key files.
2. Add documentation for performing the initial OneDrive login.
